Note: The Live server will not work as I deployed this project on Rinkeby testnet which does not exists anymore. But you can look at the code.

I built a decentralized lottery using chainlink vrf and chainlink keepers.

Note:
1. Please use Rinkeby testnet.
2. I was using chainlink keepers so it might not be working if my funds are over but code is working fine.
